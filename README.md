# Welcome

I would like to warmly welcome everyone to r/ethstaker. Please protect this community's philosophy by respecting our rules. Let me quote the most important ones here for reference:
    
* Note that the the primary goal of this community is to be welcoming first and knowledgable second.
* We welcome all persons regardless of identifying criteria. As an extension of that, we will work harder to welcome those who may appear different.
* Do not discuss or use this reddit to engage in activity that may be considered illegal.
* Keep non Ethereum staking to r/staking.
* Keep plain Ethereum development discussion to r/ethereum.
* Keep price discussion and market talk to subreddits such as /r/ethfinance or r/ethtrader.
* Keep mining discussion to subreddits such as /r/ethermining.

# What is Ethereum 2 Staking?

Ethereum 2 Staking means locking up 32 Ether and running a piece of software that secures the Ethereum 2 network. In exchange for doing this service stakers receive small payouts every 6 minutes. The new Ethereum network is still in development and stakers who deposit Ether now should expect it to be completely locked up for two years.

The **BEST** place to learn about Ethereum 2 is by reading [EIP 2982, the proposal to integrate Ethereum 2 into the Ethereum 1 system](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/5dc1b8ddd645af01c81da8817b6bcc8ff883b9d6/EIPS/eip-2982.md). /u/superphiz and /u/unvetica_solutions did a [full reading of this EIP and posted it to YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_yW7mb6glQ).

## Staking Incentives / Rewards 
### Why stake? 
- Help secure the network. 
- Help maintain decentralization/security. 
- Earn a retrun on your ETH.

### Staking Rewards
- Returns depend on how much ETH is staked.
- You will receive a return on your state, in regular small increments.
- (Post the staking returns chart here)

## Getting started on mainnet
Go to Launch Pad to stake
See the clients table for guides.

## Getting started on a testnet
Go to Launch Pad to stake
See the clients table for guides.
(SE: Will there be a testnet running during Phase 0 for newbies/client teams to practice/test on?)

## Types of staking:
### Solo
- Choosing hardware: [/u/coinmonk's guide](https://medium.com/coinmonks/what-hardware-for-an-ethereum-2-0-validator-e8f5f89de43e), [add lamboshi's guide]()
- Run your own Eth2 client (Linux/Windows/Mac)
### Custodial & Third party pooling
- Note that the Ethstaker community encourages solo staking and does not endorse services, but we WILL provide support as much as possible and we encourage you to do what's best for you.
- [Beaconcha.in](https://beaconcha.in/stakingServices) hosts a comprehensive list of custodial and third party staking services.

- Software (bugs,etc.)
- Keys (lost phrase/passwords, stolen, hacked, etc.)
- ETH2 failures (network fails - fork required, funds locked for a while)
- Funds locked for 1.5-2yrs at least
